# Boise and its fire hydrants

Riveting subject, no?

I can't give you screenshots because the overlay layers don't show up for me on either my own work or the example (yes, even with my mapbox key swapped in!). Sorry.

Furthermore, and for that reason, I can't even test whether my own stuff works. Hope it does. 

Checkin' 'em off:
- The map, such as it is, should be accessible [here.](https://github.com/arbitrary-isthmus/hydrated-boise/index.html)
- Everything should have available zoom levels of 3 to 14.
- Tilesets:
  - The first one's just the dark mapbox basemap
  - The second one contains only the location of every single fire hydrant in the city of Boise (Yes! We got every single one! Even your favorites!)
  - The third one is just the first two combined. Probably. I could check, but what's even the point anymore?
  - The fourth one is a shapeshifter and is not to be trusted.
