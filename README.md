# Boise and its fire hydrants

# IMPORTANT LAST-MINUTE PREDDENDUM:
I've been using Github's web interface to upload my repositories up until now, because other methods had various problems that I couldn't solve fast enough to turn in whatever work I had at the time I'd investigated them, back near the beginning of the quarter. It's been working well enough, *until now*...

So apparently, Github's web interface doesn't allow uploading more than 100 files at once (in my repo, there's about 5500 -- far too many to comb through and upload in manual small batches; plus, there doesn't appear to be any intra-repository mkdir/rmdir/mv functionality in the web interface). So I put the whole thing in a zip file, figuring it was better than nothing -- but nope, it also doesn't allow uploading files larger than 25MB (my zipped-up repo clocks in at about 450MB).
So *then*, I put the whole repo in a zip file split into 24MB volumes. After waiting approximately the entire runtime of The Sound of Music (read: excruciatingly long), this happens:

![ugh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arbitrary-isthmus/hydrated-boise/refs/heads/main/come-on-man.png)

So fuck my entire repository, I guess. I don't have any time at all to work on this on Thursday (02/05), but I'll try to get an alternative means of uploading a repo functioning properly over the weekend. In the meantime, I'll try and see if there's some sort of school-operated cloud storage via Outlook or whatever that I can upload that .zip to so you can at least have something to grade. I get it if you have to deduct points, but please don't give me a big fat zero due to this bullshit alone.

# Anyway, here's how this readme originally went:

Riveting subject, no?

I can't give you screenshots because the overlay layers don't show up for me on either my own work or the example (yes, even with my mapbox key swapped in!). Sorry.

Furthermore, and for that reason, I can't even test whether my own stuff works. Hope it does. 

Checkin' 'em off:
- The map, such as it is, should be accessible [here.](https://github.com/arbitrary-isthmus/hydrated-boise/index.html)
- Everything should have available zoom levels of 3 to 14.
- Tilesets:
  - The first one's just the dark mapbox basemap
  - The second one contains only the location of every single fire hydrant in the city of Boise (Yes! We got every single one! Even your favorites!)
  - The third one is just the first two combined. Probably. I could check, but what's even the point anymore?
  - The fourth one is a shapeshifter and is not to be trusted.
